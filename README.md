# Marine Dynamic Positioning System
A comprehensive implementation of a Dynamic Positioning (DP) system for marine vessels, developed as part of the TMR4240 Marine Control Systems course at NTNU. This project demonstrates advanced control system design and implementation using MATLAB/Simulink and the Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) Toolbox.

## Project Overview
The system enables precise vessel position and heading control under various environmental conditions through a sophisticated combination of observers, controllers, and thrust allocation algorithms. The implementation includes real-time simulation capabilities and comprehensive environmental force modeling.
